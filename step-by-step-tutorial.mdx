1. **Sign Up or Log In**: [Visit our site](https://devv.ai/build) and sign up for a new account or log in to your existing one.
2. **Create a New Project**: Describe the project you wanna build in the input box then create your own project. Simply give some initial context to start, and Devv will help you finish the whole thing.

## Interact with Devv agent

-  **Start the Conversation**: Begin chatting with the Devv Agent by describing what backend services you need. Use natural language to specify your requirements.
-  **Iterate**: The Devv Agent will generate code snippets and ask follow-up questions. Review the outputs and provide feedback or additional details as needed.
-  **Refine**: Keep iterating until the backend logic aligns perfectly with your project goals.

## Fill environment variables

Devv provides online testing abilitiy (works as **Postman**) to help you ensure the correctness of your api codes.

Every time you chat with Devv Builder and update your code files, the Playground tab on the right side would update and generate all apis, including necessary request params and body for you to test it.

## Publish your project

Devv Builder streamlines the deployment process with one-click publishingã€‚

1. Locate the `Deploy` button in the top-right corner of your Devv Builder interface
2. Click the button to initiate the deployment process
3. Devv Builder will automatically:
   -  Package your code
   -  Set up the necessary infrastructure
   -  Deploy your API to a secure, production-ready environment

Within seconds, you'll receive a unique domain URL where your API is accessible.

When you make changes to your API code, don't forget to click the Redeploy button to push your updates online.

After your API is created, you can generate a full documentation of your project in one-single click, including:

-  Endpoint Specifications
   -  Complete URL structure and HTTP methods
   -  Request parameters and body schema
   -  Response format and examples
   -  Authentication requirements
   -  Interactive Examples
-  Standard error codes and their meanings
   -  Error response formats
   -  Troubleshooting guidelines
