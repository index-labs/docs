**Devv is an AI-powered platform that turns your ideas into fully deployed APIs with a single promptâ€”no local setup or DevOps required.**

You can think of it as the backend version of [Bolt.new](https://Bolt.new) / [Lovable](https://lovable.dev).

Devv handles not only code generation, but also database connection, online API testing, and deployment.

For small teams, it allows for rapid development and launch of product MVPs, which is more important than fully developing a backend service during the demand validation phase.

Independent developers can also use the same backend system built by Devv to serve products on Web, iOS, and Android platforms, allowing you to focus solely on frontend interactions.
