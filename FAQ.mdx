   <Accordion title="What kind of projects can I build with Devv Builder?">
      Technically, you can build all kinds of websites on Devv, from things like
      a simple landing page, to complex AI Saas application.
   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="What's the different between Devv and other AI website builders?">
      Devv focuses on building AI-powered products, instead of a fancy landing
      page. You can find a large number of integrations while building with
      Devv, from native database, to AI text/image/audio generation. You won't
      find those easy-to-use AI capabilities in other platforms.

### While Building

<AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title="What should I do when my project gets an error?">
      <Steps>
         <Step title="First Step">
            Devv has built-in logic to catch errors in your project. If you see
            a `Fix it` button in your screen, just click the button and let Devv
            fix it automatically.
         </Step>
         <Step title="Second Step">
            If you encounter an error after clicking or making actions in your
            website, then most likely it's an API error. You can use [Devv
            Developer Console](/step-by-step-tutorial#devv-developer-console) to
            check and see what's the error, then copy error info and send it to
            Devv.
         </Step>
         <Step title="Third Step">
            You can manually [revert a
            change](/step-by-step-tutorial#revert-a-change). You will rarely use
            it. But when AI happens to write something totally wrong and destroy
            your existing project, the best practice is revert it manually
            instead of ask AI to fix it.
         </Step>
