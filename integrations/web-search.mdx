Devv Search allows your AI to search the internet based on keywords or queries.

Large Language Models (LLMs) themselves have limited knowledge about the latest news. So if you want your app to **catch up with real-time data and output results**, Devv Search will help you.

Perfect for: Q&A assistant, News aggregation, market research, content discovery, real-time data fetching, etc.
