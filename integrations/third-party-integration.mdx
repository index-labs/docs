Devv Builder offers seamless integration capabilities, empowering you to connect with external services and leverage third-party tools within your AI-generated APIs. We provide both native integrations and support for non-native integrations to maximize flexibility.

## Non-Native Integrations

Beyond native integrations, Devv Builder provides the flexibility to incorporate any third-party SDK or API. To use them, you should include necessary context in your prompt to make sure Devv could use external capabilities correctly.

### Key Considerations for Non-Native Integrations:

-  Dependency Management: Ensure that all necessary dependencies are included within your prompt.
-  Authentication: Handle authentication and authorization for external services appropriately by filling necessary environment variables in `Config`.
-  Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues with external services.

This flexible approach allows you to extend the functionality of your Devv Builder projects and tailor them to your specific needs. By combining the power of AI-generated APIs with the vast ecosystem of third-party tools, you can build sophisticated applications with minimal effort.
