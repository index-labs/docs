### How to use OpenRouter in Devv

1. Create an `API-key` inside OpenRouter, and fill the key inside Devv.

   autoPlay
   muted
   loop
   playsInline
   className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
   src="/videos/openrouter.mp4"
></video>

2. Tell Devv which LLM you wanna use. **Devv already has built-in knowledge about how to use API on OpenRouter**, so you don't need to worry about reading the documents and pass them to Devv.
