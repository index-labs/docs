[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a service that provides developers and enterprises with a single, unified API to access hundreds of Large Language Models (LLMs) from various providers like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.

### How to use OpenRouter in Devv

1. Create an `API-key` inside OpenRouter, and fill the key inside Devv.

   className="rounded-lg"
/>

2. Tell Devv which LLM you wanna use. **Devv already has built-in knowledge about how to use API on OpenRouter**, so you don't need to worry about reading the documents and pass them to Devv.
