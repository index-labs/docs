User authentication is a critical component of most modern web applications. Devv simplifies this process with its native authentication integration, allowing you to add secure user login, registration, and profile management to your applications with a single prompt.

### How It Works

When you include a requirement for user authentication in your prompt (e.g., "an app where users need to log in to see their content"), Devv automatically:

1. **Generates the Authentication UI**: Creates the login, registration, and password reset pages for your application.
2. **Sets Up the User Database**: Configures the database to securely store user credentials and profile information.
3. **Implements the Security Logic**: Writes the backend code to handle user sessions, password verification, and access control.

### Where to manage my users

As the project owner, you are able to check and mange your project users.

Select the `User` tab in your Admin dashboard, you can check all users who have registered to
your website. Plus, you are able to invite or remove users manually here.
