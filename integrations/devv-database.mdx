Devv Code's native database integration is a cornerstone feature designed to eliminate one of the biggest hurdles in web application development: database setup and management. With our native DB, you can build complex, data-driven applications without ever leaving the Devv Code environment or writing a single line of SQL.

### Key Features & Benefits

-  Zero Configuration: There are no connection strings, credentials, or schemas to manage. Devv handles everything automatically based on your natural language prompts.
-  Dynamic Schema Generation: The database schema is intelligently created and modified based on your application's needs. If you ask for a feature that requires new data to be stored, Devv automatically updates the database structure.
-  Seamless Data Management: Interact with your data through your application's UI, just as your users would. Adding, updating, and deleting data is as simple as using the application you've built.
-  Built for Non-Developers: Our native database is designed for creators who want to focus on their application's functionality, not on the technical complexities of database administration.

### How to manage it?

Select `Tables` tab in your admin dashboard, here you can:

1. Check all database tables, `view` all data and `edit` or `delete` any one them.
2. Check your `table schema`.
3. Change the `read and write permission` of each table.

Notice: We recommend to let Devv itself mange your database settings. **In most cases, you don't need to change any settings manually.**
