[Replicate](https://replicate.com/) is a cloud platform that provides an API for running, fine-tuning, and deploying open-source machine learning models, especially on image-generation field.

Replicate has gathered thousands of models in their community, and you can use them to empower your own project.

Perfect for: All kinds of image generation apps

### How to use Replicate models in Devv

1. Create an `API-key` inside OpenRouter, and fill the key inside Devv.

<video
   autoPlay
   muted
   loop
   playsInline
   className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
   src="/videos/replicate.mp4"
></video>

2. Tell Devv about your demand. **Devv already has built-in knowledge about how to use API on Replicate**, so you don't need to worry about reading the documents and pass them to Devv.
