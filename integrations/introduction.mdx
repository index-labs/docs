Devv focuses on building AI-powered product. We build Devv integrations to:

-  Make your app more powerful
-  Let everyone, even with no technical background, be able to create your first AI application with an incredibly low learning curve

You are able to choose integrations that you want to use while creating your projects. But in most cases you don't need to manually select them, just tell Devv about your product description, and Devv will select them automatically.

There are 2 types of integrations in Devv: `Native integration` and `Third-party integration`.

-  Third-party integrations will require something like an `api-key` to add it to your project.
