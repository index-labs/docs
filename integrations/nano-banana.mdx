[Gemini 2.5 Flash image](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemini-2-5-flash-image/), known as **Nano Banana** has been supported in Devv!

Nano banana is Google's state-of-the-art image generation and editing model. This update enables you to blend multiple images into a single image, maintain character consistency for rich storytelling, make targeted transformations using natural language, and use Gemini's world knowledge to generate and edit images.

### You could

1. **Blend photos together**: You can now upload multiple photos and blend them together for a brand-new scene. For example, take your photo and another of your dog to create a perfect portrait of you both on the basketball court.

2. **Multi-turn editing**: You can keep editing the images Gemini makes â€” take an empty room, paint the walls, then add a bookshelf, some furniture or a coffee table. Gemini's working with you all along to alter specific parts of an image while preserving the rest.
