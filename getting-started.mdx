## Create your first project

Simply input your project description into this box, and let Devv start working!

Notice:

1. You can also upload images, or select Devv integrations here.
2. There are lots of integrations here. Don't worry about them. You are not required to select any of them here. Indeed, Devv agent will help you select the integrations you need automatically, based on your project features.

   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Revert a Change">
      Version control is an really important feature while building your apps.
      You will rarely use it. **But when AI happens to write something totally
      wrong and destroy your existing project, the best practice is revert it
      manually instead of ask AI to fix it.**

      `App Visibility Rule` works after adding Authentication (i.e. User login
      system) to your project. There are three different options here. You can
      change it anytime by click it in your admin dashboard.

   <Accordion title="User Management">
      As the project owner, you are able to check and mange your project users.

      Select the `User` tab in your Admin dashboard, you can check all users who have registered to
      your website. Plus, you are able to invite or remove users manually here.

   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Data Management">
      Select `Tables` tab in your admin dashboard, here you can:
      1. Check all database tables, `view` all data and `edit` or `delete` any one them.
      2. Check your `table schema`.
      3. Change the `read and write permission` of each table.

      Notice: We recommend to let Devv itself mange your database settings. **In most cases, you don't need to change any settings manually.**

## Deploy and Publish your project

<AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title="Publish your project">
      In Devv, You can publish your project by `1-single-click`. Just use the
      publish button on top right, and publish a new version when you make
      modifications. You will get a public domain for your project once it
      finished.

         src="/images/publish.png"
         alt="publish"
         height="100"
         className="rounded-lg"
      />
   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Add custom domain">
      By default, you will get a random domain from Devv after publishing your
      project. But yeah, a meaningful domain would be better for your users to
      read and remember. Use `Domain` tab in your Admin panel to add custom
      domain to your project.

         src="/images/custom-domain.png"
